# Kontent.ai Subscription User Export

Tool to export the data about users in subscription using Subscripton API. 

You will need to enter your Subscription ID and Subscription API Key. Only the Subscription Admins can access this and I strongly recommend NOT to share your API key with anyone else. 

How to access your Subscription ID and Subscription API Key?

Basically, just click on your initials / Subscriptions / Subscription API, and then you will see the ID and key that you will need for this export app to work.
